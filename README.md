## Feedback

Constructive feedback is welcome! To send feedback you can visit the FoundryVTT discord and @architech99 for any feedback. Additionally, you may submit an issue here on GitLab.

## Contributing

I do occasionally accept contributions as merge requests.  However, you might want to check with me first
before you do a lot of work...

Contributions must come as merge requests on the develop branch, all others will be rejected without comment. Please follow my general coding style, and code formatting, ie opening brace on a new line, etc.  I don't care what 
you think the right way is, you can code wrong on your own projects.

I use the GitLab issue board and milestones.  Please only contribute issues slated for the next milestone, and put
the issue number in the name of the merge request.  Thanks!
